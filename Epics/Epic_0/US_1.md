**As a** user (either a startup representative or an investor),
**I want** to be able to securely sign up, sign in, and sign out of the application,
**So that** I can have a personalized and secure experience while protecting my account and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Sign Up**:
   - **Given** I am a new user,
   - **When** I navigate to the sign-up page,
   - **Then** I should be able to create an account by providing my email, password, and any other required information.
   - **And** I should receive a confirmation that my account has been created.

2. **Sign In**:
   - **Given** I am an existing user with valid credentials,
   - **When** I navigate to the sign-in page,
   - **Then** I should be able to log in using my email and password.
   - **And** upon successful login, I should receive a JWT token for accessing protected areas of the application.

3. **Sign Out**:
   - **Given** I am a logged-in user,
   - **When** I choose to sign out,
   - **Then** I should be logged out of the application.
   - **And** my JWT token should be invalidated (or the client should delete the token for security purposes).

4. **Invalid Login Attempt**:
   - **Given** I am a user trying to sign in,
   - **When** I enter incorrect login credentials,
   - **Then** I should be informed that my login attempt was unsuccessful.
   - **And** I should be prompted to try again or reset my password.

5. **Security and Data Handling**:
   - **Given** I am using the application,
   - **When** I am entering sensitive information (like password),
   - **Then** my data should be handled securely (e.g., using HTTPS).
   - **And** appropriate measures should be in place to protect my data and privacy.
